ToDo List for the Ruby on Rails Bootcamp project.

When you start the application, the first thing you will see is the page to log in or create an account.

For each user, there will be different tasks. And these tasks will only be displayed within the account they belong to. To test this function, I recommend creating two users and in each user create different tasks (You can create a task in the upper right corner).
